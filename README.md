## Results
Our findings regarding the analysis of Pewlett-Hackards aging employees can be extracted into four key points:
- There are 72,458 total employees that are retiring. 
  - This is found by utilizing the csv file and looking at total rows. 
- These 72,458 employees were all born from 1952-1955. 
- The retirements are taking place across 7 different job titles.
  - The most heavily impacted being the Senior Engineers and Senior Staff.  
- There are 1,940 employees that are eligible to be mentors.
## Summary
The two questions that Pewlett Hackard would like answered are below. 

First: There are 72,458 total upcoming retirements. That does not mean that all positions need to be filled immediately, but it does mean that there will be a restructuring of these departments at that time. 

Second: There are not enough retirement-ready employees that are able to mentor upcoming personnel. There are only 1,940 possible mentors while there are 300,000+ total employees. Not everyone will need mentoring, but it is safe to assume that this number of mentors cannot support the entirety of the staff.
